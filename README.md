# Openlogibri-lib
Openlogibri-lib is a software package to build and run software based on data flow.
This project contains the lib of the project and the runner to execute logibri's software.
It is a free software! 
It's written in C++/QT.
It can be used to build a software with graphical and alternative paradigm. Instead of typing a long sequence of text statements, you can drag and drop and wire the logic blocks.

## Status of the project
The project is in the earlier stage and it's ready for production. It cannot also be used for building the softwares yet. 
Currently the lib is incomplete and has only a little part of the entire project.
I need help writing code, and documenting the lib.
